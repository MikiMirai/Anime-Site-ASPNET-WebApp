# Anime-Site-ASPNET-WebApp
Anime site where users can review animes, give them a score and make posts on the public wall.

A template is used for the HTML and CSS part of the project but beside that you are free to look around how stuff are done and get some methods for your own web app.

I did my best to document what methods do above them and I'm sorry if something is missing.
